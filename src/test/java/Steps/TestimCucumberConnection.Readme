Testim-Cucumber Integration

    link a Testim Test with a Cucumber Scenario

=====================
Setup
=====================

    Include the class "TestimCucumberConnection.java" in your project in the same folder as your currently defined Steps.

    In the TestimCucumberConnection.java's constructor you will need to set your Testim Token and Project.
        See Testim=>Project Properties=>CLI for token and project values.

        Edit the MyConfiguration file and add your

        1. token
        2. Project
        3. config file path

    public TestimCucumberConnection() {
        this.token = "<<Your Testim Token>>";
        this.project = "<<Your Testim Project ID>>";
        this.gridName = "TESTIM-GRID";
        this.runMode = "selenium";
        this.baseUrl = null;
        this.reportFile = null;
        this.resultLabel = null;
        this.resultUrl = null;
    }

Automating a Scenario
=====================

    The following @Then clauses are available to run and process results:

        Then Testim Run Testcase (String "<<name of test>>")
        Then Testim Run Testcase (Integer <iteration>) (String "<<name of test>>")

        Then Testim Run Results Process

    Replace <<name of test>> with the name of the Testim TestCase.  You can use the name of the Scenario as the test name.

    If there is any test data it will need to be added to the "Testim Run Testcase" step just as for any step that uses data.

        For example,

        Given the following scenario:

          Scenario: Login with correct username and password
            Given I navigate to the login page of the application
            And I enter the following for Login
              | username | password  |
              | John     | whatever  |
              | nicole   | whatever  |
              | aaron    | whatever3 |
            And I click the login button
            And i do something else
            Then I should see the UserForm page

        Create a testcase in Testim called "Login with correct username and password" that automates this scenario

        Update the Scenario by adding the step "Then Testim Run Testcase" with the test data to be used:

              Scenario: Login with correct username and password
                Given I navigate to the login page of the application
                And I enter the following for Login
                  | username | password  |
                  | John     | whatever  |
                  | nicole   | whatever  |
                  | aaron    | whatever3 |
                And I click the login button
                And i do something else
                Then I should see the UserForm page

                Then Testim Run Testcase (String "Login with correct username and password")
                  | username | password  |
                  | John     | whatever  |
                  | nicole   | whatever  |
                  | aaron    | whatever3 |

        Add Then Testim Run Results Process after the 'Then Testim Run Testcase'

        Run the scenario and your Testim test should execute with the provided data.

        Bob's your uncle.

Automating a Scenario Outline

    Add the following @Then clauses to your Scenario Outline:

        Then Testim Run Testcase (Integer <iteration>) (String "<<name of test>>")

    Replace <<name of test>> with the name of the Testim TestCase.  You can use the name of the Scenario as the test name.

    If there is any test data it will need to be added to the "Testim Run Testcase" step just as for any step that uses data.

    Modify the test data passed to the step to include a leading column called "iteration"
    Scenario Outline will loop the Examples data row by row, so we need to tell "Then Testim Run Testcase" which iteration it is on.

        For example,

        Given the following Scenario Outline:

          Scenario Outline: Login with correct username and password using Scenario outline
            Given I navigate to the login page of the application
            And I enter <username> and <password>
            And I click the login button
            Then I should see the UserForm page

        Create a testcase in Testim called "Login with correct username and password" that automates this scenario

        Update the Scenario Outline by adding the step "Then Testim Run Testcase" with the test data to be used:

          Scenario Outline: Login with correct username and password using Scenario outline
            Given I navigate to the login page of the application
            And I enter <username> and <password>
            And I click the login button
            Then I should see the UserForm page

            Then Testim Run Testcase (Integer <iteration>) (String "Login with correct username and password using Scenario outline")
              | iteration | username | password |
              | 1         | nicole   | npass    |
              | 2         | barbara  | bpass    |
              | 3         | aaron    | apass    |

            Examples:
              | iteration | username | password |
              | 1         | nicole   | npass    |
              | 2         | barbara  | bpass    |
              | 3         | aaron    | apass    |
